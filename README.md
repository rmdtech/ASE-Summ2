# Project Overview
## Project Introduction üí∞
The purpose of this project is to develop a simple yet functional currency converter application, which can be integrated into the workflow at my workplace. The tool will allow users to convert a specified amount of money between two selected currencies, using exchange rates fetched from an external API. The project aims to provide an intuitive user interface and fast, accurate conversions.

This github repository will utilise publically available APIs, however a real implementation of this tool would utilise internal APIs to utilise my workplaces existing source of exchange rate data. Currently there is not a tool for converting exchange rates using internally sourced data without calculating the exchange manually, hence the proposal of this project.

## Project Requirements üéØ
#### 1. User Interface (UI) üñ•Ô∏è
- **Input Field for Amount**: Users should be able to input the amount they want to convert.
- **Selection method for Currencies**: A method is required for selecting the source currency and another for the target currency.
- **Convert Button**: A button to trigger the conversion process.
- **Result Display**: A field or label to show the converted amount.
- **Swap Currencies**: As requested by stakeholders as part of feedback on existing requirements, a "swap currencies" functionality was requested, to swap To/From currency selection for conversion. 
  
#### 2. Currency Data üíµ
- **Currency List**: At a minimum, include major currencies such as USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, etc.
- **Live Exchange Rates**: Fetch live exchange rates from an API

#### 3. Backend Logic ‚öôÔ∏è
- **Conversion Formula**: Implement a basic conversion formula:  
  `Converted Amount = Amount * Exchange Rate`
- **Fetch Exchange Rates**: Integrate API calls to retrieve current exchange rates.

#### 4. Validation ‚úÖ
- **Input Validation**: Ensure the user enters valid numbers in the amount field.
- **Currency Selection Validation**: Ensure different source and target currencies are selected.

#### 5. Error Handling ‚õî
- **Network Errors**: Display appropriate error messages if there's an issue fetching exchange rates.
- **Input Errors**: Display user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs or selections.

#### 6. Non-functional Requirements ‚è©
- **Responsive Design**: The application should be usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Performance**: The conversion process should be quick, ideally under 1 second.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

### MoSCoW Prioritisation üîù
Once all requirements were identified and confirmed with stakeholders, as listed above, each was split into one of four categories. **Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have**. This method of prioritisation is called MoSCoW, this method has been selected as it is a simple and efficient way to make it clear which features should be prioritised during the development of the currency converter application.

To correctly define each requirement, the following criteria were used for each MoSCoW catergorisation:
- **Must Have**: Essential requirements which are non-negotiable, critical for the success of the project.
- **Should Have**: Important requirements but not critical to the applications functionality, it could work without this feature.
- **Could Have**: Desireable but non-essential features, these requirements would be considered "nice to haves" or "quality of life" features.
- **Won't Have**: These are features which will not be included in this phase of the project, features included in this category may be revisited in future phases of the project but are explicity ruled out at this stage.

## User Stories üë§
To ensure a comprehensive understanding of the listed project requirements, I have drawn up a list of user stories which cover the planned functionality. The aim of this is to clarify requirements and ensure there is no accidental scope creep later in the project. Defining user stories at the planning stage helps to make sure that I can write tickets to strict requirements with clearly defined objectives.

### User Story 1: Basic Currency Conversion
**As a** user  
**I want** to convert a specific amount of money from one currency to another and have the result displayed on screen  
**So that** I can quickly see how much the amount is worth in a different currency.  

### User Story 2: Currency Pair Switching
**As a** user  
**I want** to quickly switch the selected currencies  
**So that** I can reverse the conversion without manually reselecting currencies.  

### User Story 3: Input Validation
**As a** user  
**I want** the application to notify me if I enter invalid input (e.g., non-numeric values)  
**So that** I can correct my mistakes and complete the conversion successfully.  

### User Story 4: Currency Selection
**As a** user  
**I want** to select a currency from a predetermined list  
**So that** I do not need to memorise every single currency code available.  

### User Story 5: Responsive Design
**As a** mobile phone user  
**I want** the webapp to be easy to use and navigate on my smartphone  
**So that** I can perform currency conversions whilst away from my computer.

# Project Planning üó∫Ô∏è

## Wireframing Potential Designs ‚úç
The first stage to planning the applications front end design was to utilise FIGMA to wireframe some potential designs which could later be narrowed down and further refined.  
The first step of this process was to identify the key user actions which would be involved in the process. This process had already begun through the previous work defining and agreeing upon a set of requirements for the project. To further build upon this work, I created an activity diagram which breaks down the process of creating a currency into individual steps that would be taken by the user.

### Activity Diagram
![Activity Diagram drawio](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/083addca-8b1e-4566-943e-538f1b8893bb)

### Wireframing
From the above activity diagram, I was able to build three functionaly identical, but visually different wireframe mockups. The purpose of this excerise is to experiment with very high level design concepts to determine which UI design is best suited, without having to complete a full design of each potential solution. Since a key requirement of this project is a responsive design which scales to support both desktop and mobile devices, each wireframe has been built to include a desktop as well as mobile equivalent. In addition to this, each wireframe is separated into two parts, the input phase, and the result phase. This helps to make it clear how the result of the calculation will be displayed to the user for each different design. For the purposes of wireframing, only a happypath user flow has been designed, any validation messages or error notifications will be included at the full design stage.

## Application Design ‚úç
### Colour Scheme üé®
One of the key requirements of this project is to ensure accessibility is incorporated throughout the design. The World Wide Web Consortium (https://www.w3.org/), publishes Web Content Accessibility Guidelines which provide guidance on using colour and contrast to make webpages more accessible.
My workplace already utilises a colour scheme which complies with the World Wide Web Consortiums guidelines on colour and contrast and so this project will reutilise the colour codes referenced in the below image to ensure suitable contrast between elements on the web page.

### Product Design ‚úç
Before building the application, it was important to design how it would look. To do this, I utilised the wireframe designs from earlier in the project and selected Wireframe 2 as the candidate design for further development. Wireframe 2 was chosen for it's effective use of space, clear flow and inclusion of accessible labelling of input forms.
![Comparison](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11fe1f16-841e-4cb7-b220-3d755d179d3b)  

The full design of the Currency Converter replaces generic icons and elements with colour correct designs as well as utilising the icons from Google Fonts, a free and open source repository of accessible icons.

### Error Handling ‚ö†Ô∏è
The first iteration of the full design utilised "Toast" messages to convey information about validation of network errors, however, upon further research it became clear that toast messages were not considered an accessible method of adding additional information. This is because toast messages can often cause issues for people with attention or focus disabilities, can obstruct important elements on the screen for those using zoomed-in browsers, as well as often not working well with screen readers.  
In response to this, I have updated the design to include error messages within the content, this improves accessibility as important error messages no longer automatically expire after a set period, and should also appear in a more relevant location within the DOM.

### Final Design ‚úç
Once the design elements were confirmed, I built a set of designs in Figma representing each major stage of the activity diagram previously created. This helps to give a sense of how the application will look and interact before building it. One advantage to doing this is the ability to seek feedback on designs prior to building them, this way stakeholders can comment on potential issues or concerns before too much time is spent developing a certain design.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
