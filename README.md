# Project Overview
## Project Introduction üí∞
The purpose of this project is to develop a simple yet functional currency converter application, which can be integrated into the workflow at my workplace. The tool will allow users to convert a specified amount of money between two selected currencies, using exchange rates fetched from an external API. The project aims to provide an intuitive user interface and fast, accurate conversions.

## Project Requirements üéØ
### 1. User Interface (UI) üñ•Ô∏è
- **Input Field for Amount**: Users should be able to input the amount they want to convert.
- **Selection method for Currencies**: A method is required for selecting the source currency and another for the target currency.
- **Convert Button**: A button to trigger the conversion process.
- **Result Display**: A field or label to show the converted amount.
- **Swap Currencies**: As requested by stakeholders as part of feedback on existing requirements, a "swap currencies" functionality was requested, to swap To/From currency selection for conversion. 
  
### 2. Currency Data üíµ
- **Currency List**: At a minimum, include major currencies such as USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, etc.
- **Live Exchange Rates**: Fetch live exchange rates from an API

### 3. Backend Logic ‚öôÔ∏è
- **Conversion Formula**: Implement a basic conversion formula:  
  `Converted Amount = Amount * Exchange Rate`
- **Fetch Exchange Rates**: Integrate API calls to retrieve current exchange rates.

### 4. Validation ‚úÖ
- **Input Validation**: Ensure the user enters valid numbers in the amount field.
- **Currency Selection Validation**: Ensure different source and target currencies are selected.

### 5. Error Handling ‚õî
- **Network Errors**: Display appropriate error messages if there's an issue fetching exchange rates.
- **Input Errors**: Display user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs or selections.

### 6. Non-functional Requirements ‚è©
- **Responsive Design**: The application should be usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Performance**: The conversion process should be quick, ideally under 1 second.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
